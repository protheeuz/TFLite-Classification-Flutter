# FlutterTFLite
The main goal of this project is to show an example of tensorflow lite integrated in a flutter application that classifies images in real time.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## tflite
tflite is Flutter plugin for accessing TensorFlow Lite API. Supports image classification, object detection (SSD and YOLO), Pix2Pix and Deeplab and PoseNet on both iOS and Android.

## Mobilenet
MobileNets are a set of machine learning pre-trained models for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNets
are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build light weight deep
neural networks.
